# three.js-practice

The code contains 2 ways of implementing threejs:
- Importing from a CDN
- Installing with NPM and a build tool

However the most used approach is the 2nd one.

I will sum up the important steps for making and rendering 3D objects:
>Create a scene
>
>Add the camera
>
>Create and add any 3D object eg: cube object
>
>Adjust lightening
>
>Set up the renderer
>
>Add Controls
>
>Animate the scene
>
>Finally handle the window resizing
